		<p>Sniffer dog Tucker uses his nose to help researchers find out why a killer whale population off the northwest coast of the United States is on tKe 		decline. He searches for whale faeces floating on the surface of the water, which are then collected for examination. He is one of the elite team of 		detection dogs used by scientists studying a number of species including right whales and killer whales.</p>

		Conservation canines are fast becoming indispensable tools for biologists according to Aimee Hurt, associate director and co-founder of Working Dogs 		for Conservation, based in Three Forks, Montana.
